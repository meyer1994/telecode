## Game Mechanics

**Infinite Buttons** is an exploration game where players navigate through an
infinite tree of items. The game starts with four root elements representing the
classical elements: Water 💧, Fire 🔥, Air 💨, and Earth 🌍.

### How to Play

1. **Start**: Use `/start` to begin your journey. You'll see the four root
   elements as clickable buttons.

2. **Explore**: Click on any button to navigate deeper into that branch of the
   tree. Each button represents an item with a name and emoji.

3. **Discover**: When you click on a button that doesn't have children yet, the
   AI generates up to 4 new related items on-the-fly. These items are
   semantically similar to the parent item and are added to the database for
   future players to discover.

4. **Navigate**: The game uses alternating menus that allow you to move between
   different branches. You can always close the menu and start fresh with
   `/start`.

### Game Features

- **Infinite Exploration**: The tree grows as players explore, with AI-generated
  content creating new branches dynamically.
- **Shared Discovery**: Items discovered by one player become available to all
  players, creating a collaborative exploration experience.
- **Session Tracking**: The bot tracks your current position, navigation history,
  and discovered items throughout your session.
